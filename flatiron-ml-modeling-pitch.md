# Machine Learning Modeling and Pipeline: Synthentic Data for Modeling Fraud in Ethereum Transactions

## Overview

The project pitch serves as a critical planning document that helps you clarify your approach and ensures alignment with project requirements before significant work begins. In data science projects, clear planning is essential to avoid scope creep and maintain focus on delivering business value.

This pitch will help you articulate your understanding of the business problem, outline your methodological approach, and create a realistic timeline for completion.

In data science projects, project pitches are an important first step in determining if the data you have available is viable and relevant for your business problem.
